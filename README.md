## Description

The main approach is to develop OpenRAVE plugins (contained in the [libraries/OpenravePlugins/](libraries/OpenravePlugins/) folder), which enable YARP communications. Among these, [OpenraveYarpPluginLoader](libraries/OpenravePlugins/OpenraveYarpPluginLoader) is a generic component that allows to internally load any of the YARP plugins contained in the [libraries/YarpPlugins/](libraries/YarpPlugins/) folder. These YARP plugins open ports thanks to their network wrappers. This can be seen in the following figure.

![Architecture Block Diagram](doc/fig/architecture.png)

Technically, the OpenRAVE plugin can directly open YARP ports, or contain one or many `yarp::dev::PolyDriver`. In the latter, it calls `yarp::dev::PolyDriver::open(yarp::os::Searchable &config)` passing a `yarp::os::Property` (note that `Property` is a `Searchable`), typically with the following contents:
- "device": A YARP plugin that is a general purpose network wrapper and thus opens YARP ports (`controlboardwrapper2`, `grabber`...).
- "subdevice": A YARP plugin from this repository (implementing `controlboard`, `grabber`... functionality).
- "penv": A C-style pointer to the `OpenRAVE::Environment` to be used by the "subdevice".
- "name": Can be extracted from the `OpenRAVE::Environment` and can be used for the port names opened by the "device" too.
- Plus, whatever other information the "subdevice" YARP plugin requires (e.g. which `robotIndex` and/or `manipulatorIndex` for control).

## Tutorials

### How to use openrave-yarp-plugins for collision avoidance of a simulated robot
The following commands explain how to use the openrave-yarp-plugins for collision avoidance, using the previous instance of openrave-yarp-plugins as the remote robot.

```bash
# new terminal to open the simulated robot
python examples/python/openraveYarpPluginLoader-controlboard-allManipulators.py

# new terminal to open the collision avoidance simulator
# NOTE: Expect LONG wait to load the padding model
python examples/python/openraveYarpPluginLoader-controlboard-collision-sim.py

# Then the robot can be commanded via yarp with:
yarp rpc /safe/teoSim/[kinematic chain name]/rpc:i
```

### How to use openrave-yarp-plugins for collision avoidance of a real robot
The following commands explain how to use the openrave-yarp-plugins for collision avoidance, using a real remote robot.

```bash
# new terminal
python examples/python/openraveYarpPluginLoader-controlboard-collision-real.py

# wait for the system to load the padding model
# Then the robot can be commanded via yarp with:
yarp rpc /safe/teo/[kinematic chain name]/rpc:i
```

### How to extract a .pp model from ConvexDecomposition
The following commands explain how to use openrave to create a 3D model (`.pp`) of the collision space that OpenRAVE uses to calculate collisions. Whereas OpenRAVE uses it continuously, here we can save the 3D files to use them.

```bash
openrave.py --database convexdecomposition --robot=/usr/local/share/teo-openrave-models/openrave/teo/teo.robot.xml # --padding=PADDING --maxHullVertices=MAXHULLVERTICES --mergeThresholdPercent=MERGETHRESHOLDPERCENT
```

At the time of generating the `.pp` file, different parameters can be set. In our case, the most relevant parameters are the **padding**, the **maxHullVertices** and the **mergeThresholdPercent**. **padding** represents the distance from the real plane to the one generated. The last two are used to reduce the number of triangles generated in the model.

More options can be found [here](http://openrave.org/docs/0.8.0/openravepy/databases.convexdecomposition/).

```bash
# To check the results, execute the following command. It is worth noting that, the triangle count is not correct, this was contrasted using other tool.
openrave.py --database convexdecomposition --robot=/usr/local/share/teo-openrave-models/openrave/teo/teo.robot.xml --show
```

To convert the generated `.pp` file into an `.stl` file that can be used by other programs, [openrave-pp-to-stl.py](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/openrave-tools/blob/master/openrave-pp-to-stl.py) ([perma](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/openrave-tools/blob/bd078f6d64478ca3c1b911599df56b9dc6051797/openrave-pp-to-stl.py)) can be used.
